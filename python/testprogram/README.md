This folder contains the Python test program.

Usage
=====

The purposes of `testprogram.py` are:
  - to showcase the project in association with the viewer
  - to test the Python instrumentation API.

As a first step, run the viewer then `./testprogram.py collect`.

Display the help and the options with `./testprogram.py`

Note: if the Palanteer library is not installed and the module `palanteer_stub.py` is not reachable in the Python path, the program will not run.
