<h1> @@ <a href="index.html">Overview</a> </h1>
<h1> @@ <a href="#">Getting started</a> </h1>


To get started on a standard desktop, ensure that the following components are installed:

  - A C++ 14 (or above) compiler
     - Linux: `gcc6.1+` or `clang3.3+`
     - Windows: an installation of the Visual Studio compiler 2017+, and `vcvarsall.bat` called beforehand
  - `CMake`
     - On Windows, it is included in MSVC distribution
     - Not required for a C++ program (the instrumentation library is just a C++ header)
  - Python 3.7+
     - CPython version only, due to the C extension modules
     - Required for the Python instrumentation and the scripting module only

## Quick install

**1) Build all components**

  1. Clone the GIT repository, if not already done:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ shell
git clone https://github.com/dfeneyrou/palanteer
cd palanteer
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1. Build all components (viewer, C++ test program example, Python instrumentation package, Python scripting module)
    - On Linux:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j$(nproc)
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Output: `./bin/palanter` (viewer), `./bin/testprogram` (example program) and the installation of the two Python packages, for the user (no need for root rights)
    - On Windows:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ shell
('vcvarsall.bat' or equivalent shall be called beforehand)
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "NMake Makefiles"
nmake
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Output: `bin\palanter.exe` (viewer), `bin\testprogram.exe` (example program) and the installation of the two Python packages, for the user (no need for administrator rights)

!!!
    The components can be built independently with the following targets:
      - `palanteer`: the viewer
      - `testprogram`: the C++ test program
      - `scripting`: the python scripting module
      - `python_instrumentation`: the python instrumentation module

## Quick  demo

  1. Build all components, as described in the section above
  1. Launch the viewer:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ shell
./bin/palanteer&    (Linux)
  or
bin\palanteer.exe  (Windows)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The catalog of records is of course empty and no views are present. Let's fix that!
  1. Launch the C++ test program:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ shell
./bin/testprogram collect    (Linux)
  or
bin\testprogram.exe collect  (Windows)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Alternatively, the C++ test program can be replaced by the Python test program (their behavior is similar):
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ shell
../python/testprogram/testprogram.py collect  (Linux)
  or
..\python\testprogram\testprogram.py collect  (Windows)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Launched with defaults settings, it connects to the viewer through sockets and do some tremendously interesting computations (hum...) for a few seconds. <br/>
    During the execution, the `Palanteer` viewer shows the collected information *live* while storing the record. <br/>
    Once the test program execution is finished, the record is accessible *offline* at any time from the viewer. Records are stored per application and their list can be managed inside the viewer.
    ![](images/live_recording.gif)
  1. Start inspecting the record <br/>
     - Add a timeline: in the menu bar, select `Views->New timeline`
     - Read the small help: in the menu bar, select `Help->Get started`
     - The main navigation items to remember are:
       - Zoom with `ctrl-Mouse wheel`  (or `ctrl-up/down arrow keys`)
       - Move with `right button drag` (or `arrow keys`)
       - Open a contextual menu (try on scopes and thread bars) with `click right`
       - Hit "`H`" for help on the current view
       - Hit "`F`" to toggle the full display on the current view
  1. You are already an expert!
  1. Here is an alternative experiment:
     - launch again the testprogram (C++ or Python) with the additional "-f" option. It then uses the `file storage` mode.
        - The viewer is not required, it should not react at all.
        - A file `example_record.pltraw` is created
     - In the viewer, import this file with the menu bar `File->Import`. It replays the raw data from the file and creates a second stored record from it.
  1. If you want to go a bit further:
    - Have a look and play with the options of the test program (usage is displayed when launched without arguments)
    - Run the test program with privileged rights (root or administrator) to see the core usage information.


## Quick C++ program instrumentation

**1) "Install" the C++ instrumentation library in your program**

  1. Copy the file `c++/palanteer.h` inside your sources so that it is accessible.

**2) Start, stop, and some instrumentation**

  1. As most single header libraries, it needs to be "implemented" once, just by adding `#define PL_IMPLEMENTATION 1` before the include in one of your files:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
#define PL_IMPLEMENTATION 1
#include "palanteer.h"
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1. Initialize it to start the tracing: <br/>
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
plInitAndStart("my program name");
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     From this point, memory allocations and context switches (if enough privileges) will be automatically tracked, even without manual instrumentation.
  1. Instrument the parts of the code that you want to observe
     - As a start, try to mark some scope starts using `plScope("a name here")`. Scopes will be closed automatically at the end of the C++ scope.
     - Inside a scope (important), log some variable values with `plVar(variable name 1, variable name 2, ...)` or named data with `plData("data name", value)`
  1. Before exiting the program, deactivate the service <br/>
     This flushes properly the end of the recording.
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
plStopAndUninit();
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**3) Update your build system**

  1. Add the compilation flag `USE_PL=1` into your build script for all files, and allow multi-threading
    - By default, the library is fully disabled (no code)
    - Multi-threading is required by `Palanteer` to send data to the server in its own thread.
  1. That is it! The window to see inside your program is open!


!!! Tip
    The example program `testprogram` covers many instrumentation topics. <br/>
    Looking at its documented source code and its behavior in front of the viewer, is definitely a good quick starter.


## Quick Python program instrumentation

The quickest way to profile an existing and unmodified Python program is to:
  - Launch the viewer (see [Quick Install](#quickinstall))
  - Launch the program, as with `cProfile` but with the `palanteer` module:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ none
 > python3 -m palanteer &lt;existing Python program&gt;
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The automatic instrumentation covers function enter/leave, exceptions, garbage collector runs and memory allocations (OS calls). <br/>
  Context switches are also logged if run with enough privileges.

The other way is to instrument manually (additionally to automatic instrumentation or not):
  1. Import the `palanteer` module:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
import palanteer  # Keep the namespace
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    or rather import the few instrumentation functions inside your scope, as they are prefixed with `pl`:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
from palanteer import *
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1. Initialize it to start the tracing: <br/>
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
plInitAndStart("my program name")  # Add ", with_functions=False" to disable the automatic functions enter/leave tracing
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     From this point, the automatic tracing is started, if activated (it is the case with previous example initialization).
  1. Instrument the parts of the code that you want to observe
     - As a start, try to mark some scope starts using `plBegin("a name here")` and `plEnd("a name here")` (do not forget to "end" each "begin").
     - Inside a scope (important), log some named data with `plData("data name", value)`
  1. Before exiting the program, deactivate the service <br/>
     This flushes properly the end of the recording.
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
plStopAndUninit()
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1. That is it! The window to see inside your program is open!

!!!
    In order to share a program without any hard dependency on `Palanteer`, it is rather recommended to include it this way:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
    try:
        import palanteer
    except ModuleNotFoundError:
        import palanteer_stub as palanteer  # Fallback with empty functions
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    with the helper file `palanteer_stub.py` accessible in your program (it is located in `./tools`).


!!! Tip
    The example program `./python/testprogram/testprogram.py` covers many instrumentation topics. <br/>
    Looking at its documented source code and its behavior in front of the viewer, is definitely a good quick starter.


## Quick C++ logging usage

If you are interested in the logging facility (i.e. timestamped printf-like messages with a level and category) without any recording, the console display service is available even when the service is not started or inactive. <br/>
In this case, the following steps are enough:

**1) "Install" the C++ instrumentation library in your program**

  1. Copy the file `c++/palanteer.h` inside your sources so that it is accessible.

  1. As most single header libraries, it needs to be "implemented" once, just by adding `#define PL_IMPLEMENTATION 1` before the include in one of your files:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
#define PL_IMPLEMENTATION 1
#include "palanteer.h"
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**2) Use the logging service**

1. Configure the minimum console display level

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
// Available levels are PL_LOG_LEVEL_ALL=PL_LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG, PL_LOG_LEVEL_INFO, PL_LOG_LEVEL_WARN (default), PL_LOG_LEVEL_ERROR or PL_LOG_LEVEL_NONE
plSetLogLevelConsole(level);
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This can be done dynamically at any time.

2. Instrument your code with the simple logging API

The complete list of API is:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
// Logging APIs
plLogDebug("category", "printf-like format string", ...);
plLogInfo ("category", "printf-like format string", ...);
plLogWarn ("category", "printf-like format string", ...);
plLogError("category", "printf-like format string", ...);

// "Group" versions exists also
plgLogDebug(GROUP_NAME, "category", "printf-like format string", ...);
...
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some examples of calls:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
plLogInfo("attack", "Monster %s was hit with damages %d", monsterNames[monsterId], damageQty);

plgLogError(DETAILS, "recovery", "File %s could not be opened. Error code is %08x", filename, errorCode);
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

!!! warning
    Console display is not a "nanosecond" operation. It requires parsing and formatting of all parameters, plus the console output. <br/>
    For heavy logging, disabling the console display and recording is recommended. The viewer can display the logs in real-time if needed.

!!! warning
    Console output is implemented with a simple printf. Under Windows, GUI application shall redirect the output to see the logs.

!!!
    To add the recording to the steps above, just call `plInitAndStart` in connected or file mode. <br/>
    Console output and log recording are independant, and the minimum recording level can be configured dynamically with:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
// Available levels are PL_LOG_LEVEL_ALL=PL_LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG (default), PL_LOG_LEVEL_INFO, PL_LOG_LEVEL_WARN, PL_LOG_LEVEL_ERROR or PL_LOG_LEVEL_NONE
plSetLogLevelRecord(level);
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Recorded logs can be visualized and exported in text form through the viewer.


## Quick C++ automatic functions instrumentation

The automatic C++ functions instrumentation feature is a quick and easy way to profile or observe your program.

!!! tip
    Be aware that this potentially heavy instrumentation is non-optimal and may alter the timings that you would observe in standard conditions.

More details on this procedure can be found in the description of the configuration flag [PL_IMPL_AUTO_INSTRUMENT](instrumentation_configuration_cpp.md.html#pl_impl_auto_instrument).


The steps to enables the automatic instrumentation of functions are:

**1) Add the compilation flag PL_IMPL_AUTO_INSTRUMENT=1 where `Palanteer` is implemented**

This `Palanteer` flag activates the collection the virtual base address at runtime and adds the implementation of the `GCC` hooks.

**2) Add the following compilation flags on each file to auto-instrument**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ none
-g -finstrument-functions -finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=palanteer.h,include/c++,/bits/
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These flags add the debug symbols in the executable (whatever the optimization level), enable the addition of the hooks and exclude some files from the auto-instrumentation (the provided exclusion list fits a Debian distribution). <br/>
Indeed, it is important to not instrument the functions used during the low level event tracing to avoid a "Larsen effect". <br/>
The [PL_IMPL_AUTO_INSTRUMENT section](instrumentation_configuration_cpp.md.html#pl_impl_auto_instrument) discusses this important point with more details.

**3) Add the "-ldl" to the linker command line**

Getting the virtual base address of the program at run time requires calling the `dlsym()` function from the `dl` library.

**4) Generate the lookup *function address->strings* from the ELF binary**

It shall be generated with the external string lookup generation tool, after each new built ELF executable, as the function address are tighly linked to it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ shell
./tools/extStringCppParser.py -exe ./build/bin/testprogram  > ./build/bin/testprogram.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

!!! note
    This tool can create a string lookup including both the strings from parsing the source (external string feature) and the strings from the ELF binary (automatic instrumentation feature)

This lookup is text based, one entry per line, formatted as shown in the example below (see also [Quick C++ external string configuration](#quickc++externalstringconfiguration) in the next section):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ none
@@000000000000ADB0@@evaluatePerformance(plMode, char const*, int)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**5) Provide the lookup path to the viewer**

In the record catalog tab of the viewer, right clicking on the application name proposes to select the lookup *path*. <br/>
The lookup file pointed by this lookup path is copied at recording time so that the record is associated with this particular lookup for this particular binary. <br/>
The copied lookup for a particular record can always be replaced: right clicking on the record name proposes such action. This is convenient if the lookup at recording time was not the right one. Generating the lookup inside your build system, in association with the program build, is the best way to prevent any lookup mismatch problem.

If no lookup is provided or a string is not present inside the lookup, only the string hash will be shown instead of the text content (ex: `@@458F1F00DF1C00B1@@`)

<br/>
When using CMake, the steps **1)** to **4)** can be implemented as:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ make
# Enable the automatic function instrumentation feature
add_definitions(-DPL_IMPL_AUTO_INSTRUMENT=1)

# Compilation: add required flags (independent of the optimization level)
add_compile_options(-g -finstrument-functions -finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=palanteer.h,include/c++,/bits/)

# Link:
# add "dl" to the dependency library list in target_link_libraries(...)

# Command which builds the lookup from the sources (external strings feature) and the binary (auto instrumentation feature)
# This working example is copied from the testprogram CMakeFile.txt. You shall adapt it by replacing the target "testprogram" with your own, and optionally modify
# some options of the "extStringCppParser.py" tool as it currently generates the lookup for both the external strings feature and automatic instrumentation, 
# with a hash salt of zero and a 64 bit hash.
add_custom_command(TARGET "testprogram" POST_BUILD
    COMMAND ${Python3_EXECUTABLE} "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/tools/extStringCppParser.py" --exe "$<TARGET_FILE:testprogram>" ${TESTPROGRAM_SRC} > "$<TARGET_FILE:testprogram>.txt"
    WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}
    COMMENT "Generating the string lookup..."
    )

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

!!! error
    This feature is supported only on Linux with GCC compiler

!!! tip
    Clang contains also the same mechanism but unfinished and cannot be used in the context of `Palanteer`. Indeed, it is not possible to exclude any files or functions. <br/>
    And all functions used during the low level event tracing shall be excluded to avoid a fatal "Larsen effect". <br/>
    Clang support will be added as soon as a usable way is available.

## Quick C++ external string configuration

The external string feature strips all static strings from the instrumentation and assertions at compile time, so that:

  * the instrumentation is obfuscated
  * the binary size is reduced (`text` or `.rodata` section)


**1) Activate the feature by adding the compilation flag PL_EXTERNAL_STRINGS=1 on all instrumented files**

On Linux, you can verify the absence of such static strings with:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ shell
(Remove any debug symbol)
strip ./bin/testprogram

(Display all 4+ length displayable text string)
strings ./bin/testprogram
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**2) Generate the lookup *hash->strings* from your sources**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ shell
./tools/extStringCppParser.py ./c++/testprogram/testProgram.cpp > testProgramLookup.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

!!! note
    This tool can create a string lookup including both the strings from parsing the source (external string feature) and the strings from the ELF binary (automatic instrumentation feature)

This lookup is text based, one entry per line, formatted as shown in the example below:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ none
@@458F1F00DF1C00B1@@Too big command received
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**3a) Register the lookup into the viewer for this program name**

In the record catalog tab of the viewer, right clicking on the application name proposes to "update pathname of the external strings lookup". <br/>
The lookup file pointed by this lookup path is copied at recording time. It can always be replaced later: right clicking on the record name proposes such action. <br/>
If no lookup is provided or a string is not present inside the lookup, only the string hash will be shown instead of the text content (ex: `@@458F1F00DF1C00B1@@`)

**3b) Register this lookup through the scripting python module**

Scripts do not require the content of strings to work properly, as they internally use the hash of the strings instead.<br/>
Registering a string lookup is useful mainly when debugging scripts, as non-obfuscated strings are helpful in this case. An alternative is to use a non-external-string program during this phase.

This registration is done through the [set_external_strings](scripting_api.md.html#set_external_strings) scripting API.

## Quick remote scripting

The remote control is done in Python via the `Palanteer` scripting module. <br/>
In conjunction with the instrumented program, it enables dynamic thread control, remote command execution and observation of any events.

**1) Follow the [quick install](#quickinstall) to build the `Palanteer` scripting Python module**

**2) Have your instrumented program ready**

Without manual instrumentation (case of an unmodified Python script), the only possibility is to observe some automatically instrumented events, without any control on the program. <br/>
CLIs, freeze points, variable content tracing... are what makes scripting reliable and powerful...

**3) Write the python script**

  1. Import the `palanteer_scripting` module and [initialize](scripting_api.md.html#initialize_scripting) it:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
import palanteer_scripting

palanteer_scripting.initialize_scripting()  # To do once, anywhere before the first call to Palanteer API
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    If the `import` fails, double-check the `Palanteer` installation step.
  1. [Launch](scripting_api.md.html#process_launch) your program:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
palanteer_scripting.process_launch("myProgram.exe", [ &lt;parameters...&gt; ])
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1. Interact with it<br/>
     * Define some [events of interest](scripting_api.md.html#data_configure_events) through event specs:
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
# Define your event/lock/log capture specifications
my_selection = palanteer_scripting.EvtSpec(thread="MyThread", events=["first event", "top event/**/child event", ...])
# Apply a selection of the event specifications
palanteer_scripting.data_configure_events(my_selection)
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     * [Receive](scripting_api.md.html#data_collect_events) the corresponding events:
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
# Just an example
while palanteer_scripting.process_is_running():
  events = palanteer_scripting.data_collect_events(timeout_sec=1)  # Batch reception
  for e in events:
     ...  # Do something with them
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     * [Freeze/unfreeze](scripting_api.md.html#program_set_freeze_mode) threads at some instrumented freeze points:
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
palanteer_scripting.program_set_freeze_mode(True)
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     * [Call](scripting_api.md.html#program_cli) some [CLI](base_concepts.md.html#commandlineinterface) declared inside the program:
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
palanteer_scripting.program_cli("config:set_mode mode=init phase=14")
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1. Loop on 3. (interact with the program), or [stop](scripting_api.md.html#process_stop) it:
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
palanteer_scripting.process_stop()
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1. Loop on 2. (new launch) if desired:
  1. Do some [cleaning](scripting_api.md.html#uninitialize_scripting) before exit:
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
palanteer_scripting.uninitialize_scripting()
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Note that launched programs which are still running are killed automatically at library uninitialization time or script exit.
