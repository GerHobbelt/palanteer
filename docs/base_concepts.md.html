## C++ specific

### Groups

**Groups** provide the compile-time ability to keep or remove a selection of `Palanteer` directives. <br/>
Their effect applies both on instrumentation and assertions, as if they were tagged for selection.

A group is simply defined as a preprocessor constant starting with **`PL_GROUP_`** with the value 0 (disable) or 1 (enabled).

Most `Palanteer` commands have an equivalent using groups.]
Their prefix is then **`plg`** and their first parameter is the group name without the prefix.


Example (supposing by default that the compilation flags USE_PL=1 and PL_NOEVENT and PL_NOASSERT are not set to 1):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
// Defines the group ITERATOR
#define PL_GROUP_ITERATOR 1

// This instrumentation is present in the code
plData("Monster health", health);

// This instrumentation is present in the code only if PL_GROUP_ITERATOR is 1
plgData(ITERATOR, "Detailed monster health", health);


// This assertion is present in the code
plAssert(health>=0);

// This assertion is present in the code only if PL_GROUP_ITERATOR is 1
plgAssert(ITERATOR, health>=0);

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

!!! warning
    Once used in any `Palanteer` call, this constant **must be defined**. If not, the C++ preprocessor rants like hell...

!!! Tip
    A disabled group (value 0) means that the code is fully removed at compile-time and has a zero run-time cost.

Several group configuration strategies are discussed [here](instrumentation_configuration_cpp.md.html#configurationstrategies)

### Static and dynamic strings

In `Palanteer` each string in the instrumentation is hashed.

  * When the hashing is performed at compiled time, the string is called "static"
    * For C++, the corresponding constraint is: "the C string is _constexpr_"
  * When the hashing is performed at run time, the string is called "dynamic"
    * Obviously with a run-time cost

Static strings have almost the same run-time cost as a numerical value because only their hash is used. <br/>
The delta is one hashtable query and the string content sending once to the server if the "external strings" feature is not used.

The run-time differences between both types of strings are:

  * Dynamic strings content is copied during the function call, static strings have just their pointer copied
     * Because the content pointed by the static strings is persistent (read-only section)
  * Dynamic strings are hashed at run time, static strings have pre-computed hash at compile time

Some instrumentation functions have both a static and a dynamic string version (with suffix "Dyn").

  * `plDeclareThread` and `plDeclareThreadDyn`
  * `plFunction` and `plFunctionDyn`


Unless with the explicit prefix "Dyn", the strings are expected to be static. The exception is `plData` which is a multi-type tracing function which accepts numerical values and dynamic strings. Functions with parameters `name` and `value` expect `name` to be static.

Some examples:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
// Text tracing
plText("stage", "Phase one reached"); // Static string

// Text tracing
constexpr const char* myConstExprString = "I am a static string because constexpr";
plText("stage", myConstExprString); // OK, as myConstExprString is "constexpr"

// Data tracing (numeric or string)
const char* myConstString = "I am not a static string"; // Dynamic string API required because not constexpr. "const" is not enough for compile time processing.
plData("Status", myConstString); // plData always considers the value string as dynamic, so it is hashed at run-time.

// Function scope tracing
plFunction();    // Works only for some recent compilers, see warning in plFunction API description
plFunctionDyn(); // Always works but uses a dynamic string
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

!!! error
    Tens of preprocessor and compiler errors are triggered if a static string API is used instead of  a dynamic one. These errors usually start with:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
    palanteer.h: error: "string variable" is not a constant expression
     | #define PL_STRINGHASH(s) plPriv::forceCompileTimeElseError_ < plPriv::fnv1a_(s,PL_FNV_HASH_OFFSET_) > ::compileTimeValue
     ...
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    In that case, just switch to the "Dyn" variant.

A noticeable point is that only the static strings can be obfuscated/removed by the "external strings" feature because of the compile-time processing. <br/>
Always prefer static strings whenever you can.

Some non-trivial use-cases can somehow be covered by static strings with some changes:

  - Using an array of static strings with a run-time selection of the index: see next section about [plString_t](#plstring_t)
  - Having a dump similar to printf: use a scope and lay the values inside
    - indeed the formatting is not equivalent, but the semantic is.
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
// Target form
printf("The monster with index %d has a health of %f %%\n", monsterIndex, monsterHealth);

// Static string form
{
    plScope("Monster");
    plData("index", monsterIndex);
    plData("health##percent", monsterHealth);
}
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### plString_t

`Palanteer` defines an helper struct `plString_t` which is an explicit association of a static string and a hash.<br/>
When the "external string" feature is active, the string is stripped at compile time and only the hash remains.

`plString_t` basically decorrelates the known-at-compile-time string declaration from its usage so that it is possible to benefit of the "external string" feature despite a dynamic choice.

The declaration is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
// Full definition of the plString_t helper
struct plString_t {
    plString_t(void) = default;
    plString_t(const char* value_, plPriv::hashStr_t hash_) : value(value_), hash(hash_) {}
    const char*       value; // May be null (case of external strings)
    plPriv::hashStr_t hash;  // Zero means no hash precomputed
};

// Function (equivalent C++ prototype of the macro) that must be used to create a plString_t
plString_t plMakeString(constexpr const char* string);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`plString_t` shall always be constructed through `plMakeString` so that the string hash is properly computed. <br/>
It can then be used in any `Palanteer` function where a dynamic string is expected but benefit from static string performances.

!!! warning
    Ideally, the static and dynamic string APIs should be one and unique, but it is not possible in C++ due to the limited `constexpr` discrimination for parameters (see details [here](#usageofmacrosinthec++instrumentationlibrary)). <br/>
    For the same technical reason, the "Dyn" API variant is the only possible one to accept a `plString_t`.

Example:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
// Array of static strings. Their hash is precomputed at compile-time.
plString_t monsterNames[3] = { plMakeString("Orc"), plMakeString("Dragon"), plMakeString("Bunny") };

// plData processes the plString_t as a static string because the string hash is already computed at compile-time.
// If it were a simple "const char*", it would be processed as a dynamic string because not "constexpr".
plData("monster name", monsterNames[monsterIdx]);

// All dynamic tracing function work with the behavior and performance of a static string when provided a plString_t
plScopeDyn(monsterNames[monsterIdx]);
plDeclareThreadDyn(monsterNames[monsterIdx]);
plLockWaitDyn(monsterNames[monsterIdx]);
...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

!!!
    `plString_t` can also be used outside of `Palanteer` instrumentation if you find some interest in compile-time hashed strings. <br/>
    But be aware that in case the "external string" feature is enabled, the string content is not available (null `value` pointer)

### Manual scopes

Two different ways to create a scope, i.e. a start and end events defining a timed named zone, are described in the [instrumentation API reference for hierarchical structure](instrumentation_api_cpp.md.html#structuretracing):

 - explicit end: with `plBegin(...)` to mark the start of the scope and `plEnd(...)` to mark its end.
 - implicit end: with `plScope(...)`, which is equivalent to a `plBegin()` associated to an automatic `plEnd()` at the end of the C++ scope (RAII defer property).

The automatic closing of the `plScope(...)` function makes it much safer to use as it enforces the hierarchical constraints:

   - a `plScope(...)` is always closed
   - a `plScope(...)` cannot create interlaced scopes

The parameter `name` provided inside `plEnd(name)` is only used to detect a mismatch on server side. The viewer reports such errors which highlight a corruption of the instrumentation. <br/>
The typical errors are:

- closing or opening scopes "too much"
  - breaks the hierarchical structure of the data. An indicator is some mismatching "start" and "end" events.
- interlaced scopes
  - example of interlacing error: `plBegin("A")` ==> `plBegin("B")` ==> `plEnd("A")` ==> `plEnd("B")` <br/>
    The scope would be understood as `plBegin("A")` ==> `plBegin("B")` ==> `plEnd("B")` ==> `plEnd("A")`, and two errors (double mismatch) reported on server side.

As a summary, `plBegin(...)` and `plEnd(...)` are sometimes convenient but be careful when using them instead of `plScope(...)`.

!!! info
    The rules are:

      - If the displayed data structure reaches the maximum hierarchical level, just check if you did not forget some `plEnd(...)` calls. <br/>
      - If the displayed data structure seems to miss some levels or stuck at the top level, just check that you do not have extra `plEnd(...)` calls. <br/>
      - And in any case, do not let an instrumentation error without corrective action. Looking at them should prevent all issues.

!!! warning
    Providing an empty name as in `plEnd("")` is accepted for convenience and acts like a wildcard. <br/>
    But it is more dangerous as no error is detected in case of mismatch.

### Event collection mechanism

Collecting events must be as light as possible. Indeed, the instrumentation shall not ruin the timing observations. <br/>
That is why it respects these constraints:

  - no memory allocation allowed
    - they mess up the program memory observation, are CPU heavy, may flush part of the cache and have unpredictable timings
  - only fast and simple processing
    - basically storage
  - lock-free
    - use of atomic types
    - no blocking unless buffer overflows, and in this case a mark shall be added in the record

The implication is that the task to send these events to the server is performed in a dedicated `Palanteer/Transmission` thread (hence the multi-thread requirement). <br/>
The used scheme is a double storage banks:

  - one bank is currently filled by the instrumentation
  - the other (already filled) is sent to the server then available for swapping

Each bank is represented by a buffer of the size [`PL_IMPL_COLLECTION_BUFFER_BYTE_QTY`](instrumentation_configuration_cpp.md.html#pl_impl_collection_buffer_byte_qty). <br/>
The collection thread checks regularly (~5 ms) if either:

  * the current filled bank is filled at least at 1/8 of its capacity
  * the current filled bank is non empty and the last sending was at least some time ago (value controled by the server)

In this case, it swaps the banks atomically and process the previously filled bank.

!!! Warning
   If the collection buffer size is too small to receive all generated events during the ~5 ms harvesting period, the event tracing command busy-waits until the next bank swap.<br/>
   As the timing of the program is altered, an error log is forced inside the `Palanteer\Transmission` thread:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
plLogError("SATURATION", "EVENT BUFFER IS FULL. PLEASE INCREASE ITS SIZE FOR CORRECT MEASUREMENTS");
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   If this log is present, the value of [`PL_IMPL_COLLECTION_BUFFER_BYTE_QTY`](instrumentation_configuration_cpp.md.html#pl_impl_collection_buffer_byte_qty) shall be increased. <br/>
   Note that the default value (1 MB) is dimensioned for an average of more than 3 million events per second, knowing that only the "peak rate" on these 5 ms matters.


Some more information:

  - `Palanteer` creates 2 threads
    - `Palanteer\Transmission` collects event and send them to the server
    - `Palanteer\Reception` receives commands from the server
    - a third one `Palanteer/winTraceLogger` is created only on Windows if the OS context switch collection is enabled
  - the group `PL_VERBOSE` (enabled by default) controls the event tracing of the `Palanteer` threads
  - the dynamic strings are preallocated and if the pool is depleted during a collection cycle, then the same process than the buffer overflow is applied: the thread busy-waits and an explicit error log is recorded.
    - in this case, the value of [`PL_IMPL_DYN_STRING_QTY`](instrumentation_configuration_cpp.md.html#pl_impl_dyn_string_qty) shall be increased.



## Python specific

### Manual scopes

In Python, all function entering or leaving is automatically instrumented by default.

More scopes, i.e. a start and end events defining a timed named zone, can be manually added with `plBegin(&lt;name&gt;)` to mark the start of the scope and `plEnd(&lt;name&gt;)` to mark its end.

The string parameter `name` provided inside `plEnd(&lt;name&gt;)` is only used to detect a mismatch on server side. The viewer reports such errors which highlight a corruption of the instrumentation. <br/>
The typical errors are:

- closing or opening scopes "too much"
  - breaks the hierarchical structure of the data. An indicator is some mismatching "start" and "end" events.
- interlaced scopes
  - example of interlacing error: `plBegin("A")` ==> `plBegin("B")` ==> `plEnd("A")` ==> `plEnd("B")` <br/>
    The scope would be understood as `plBegin("A")` ==> `plBegin("B")` ==> `plEnd("B")` ==> `plEnd("A")`, and two errors (double mismatch) reported on server side.

!!! info
    The rules are:

      - If the displayed data structure reaches the maximum hierarchical level, just check if you did not forget some `plEnd(...)` calls. <br/>
      - If the displayed data structure seems to miss some levels or stuck at the top level, just check that you do not have extra `plEnd(...)` calls. <br/>
      - And in any case, do not let an instrumentation error without corrective action. Looking at them should prevent all issues.

!!! warning
    Providing an empty name as in `plEnd("")` is accepted for convenience and acts like a wildcard. <br/>
    But it is more dangerous as no error is detected in case of mismatch.

The Python language offers some ways to mitigate this risk (see [plBegin and plEnd](instrumentation_api_python.md.html#plbeginandplend) for template code):
 - using the `with` statement, which is a RAII construct
 - using the function decorator [`@plFunction`](instrumentation_api_python.md.html#plbeginandplend), in case automatic function instrumentation is disabled

### Event collection mechanism

The python instrumentation module wraps the C++ instrumentation library, the event collection mechanism is identical. <br/>
Please refer to the [C++ event collection mechanism](#baseconcepts/c++specific/eventcollectionmechanism) for details.


However, Python is a higher level and interpreted language which implies that:
  - it requires less control on the hardware
  - the maximum tracing rate is lower than in C++
  - more dynamic strings are used as the concept of "static string" does not exist in Python

The inner C++ instrumentation library is configured once for all, taking these points into consideration. <br/>
There is no configuration parameters for the Python instrumentation module.


## Event tracing

### Unique strings and event kinds

The design of `Palanteer` leverages redundancies, notably:
  - strings whose identical content can be logged many times
  - events which are positioned at the same place in the hierarchical tracing tree.

All strings are hashed as early as possible. This enables efficient string unicity check. <br/>
Each unique string is assigned an integer ID, and is processed and stored only once.

Each event is intrinsically associated to a "path" in the hierarchical tracing tree, composed by the name of all "parent scope events", for a given thread. <br/>
This association is what defines an "event kind", all its values can be viewed and manipulated as a whole.

### Structured tracing is preferred

A typical log (taken from Linux /var/log/auth.log) looks like:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ none
May 30 00:21:51 laptop sudo: pam_unix(sudo:session): session opened for user root by (uid=0)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the message is human readable, it bundles several parts with different semantics:
 - the date
 - the machine name
 - the executable
 - a text message
 - a user ID

While simple, this log is sub-optimal in many ways:
 - generating the log requires a string formatting call
 - each time the same kind of event happens, a very similar but different string will be logged
 - no easy manipulation can be done with it without parsing and decomposing it by semantic parts
 - no easy association can be done in a serie of such logs

The preferred approach in `Palanteer` is to log per semantic parts. Two variants are possible:
  1. hierarchical traces
  1. logs

The hierarchical trace variant is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
{
    plScope("session opened for user root");  // Timestamped event, its end is also logged at the end of the C++ scope
    plData("machine", "laptop");
    plData("executable", "sudo");
    plData("by uid", 0);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - The cost on the network is bit higher in this example
   - the example text log is 92 characters long, the structured log is 5*24=120 bytes
 - The CPU cost is much lower (~5*20ns) as no string allocation (all static strings) nor formatting call are required
 - All string contents are sent once, only their ID is sent the next times
 - All 3 named fields can be directly plotted, have an histogram, be searched, etc...

The logging variant is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
    plLogInfo("%s %s: session opened for user root by (uid=%d)", "laptop", "sudo", 0);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - The cost on the network is smaller: 1 event for the timestamped log with the format string + 1 event which packs the 3 parameters
   - the example text log is 92 characters long, the structured log is 2*24=48 bytes
 - The base CPU cost is lower (~2*20ns here) as no formatting call are required, but strings requires hashing
 - All string contents are sent once, only their ID is sent the next times
 - All 3 fields can be directly plotted, have an histogram, be searched, etc...
   - but they have no name


### Log parameters

The efficiency of the logging service comes from the deferred formatting and the generic compile time pre-computations (hashed strings and variadic templates).

The first event of a log call is the timestamped "log event" containing the level, the category and the format string (both are static strings). <br/>
The category and the format strings are processed at compile time and sent only once to the server.

If present, the parameters are "packed" as much as possible inside dedicated parameter events (events are the fundamental item of data exchange), their quantity depends on their type and order:
  - `int` and `float` take 4 bytes
  - 64 bits integers, pointers, `double`, and character strings take 8 bytes. <br/>
    In the compact model, note that these types are downgraded into their 32 bits versions.

In the standard model (respectively compact model), 20 bytes (respectively 8 bytes) are available per event. Parameters are packed until all are stored or the event cannot hold the new parameter. In this case, another parameter event is added and the packing process continues.

Example of space occupied:
  - 5 `int` or `float` can hold in 1 "parameter" event. So a log with up to 5 such parameters hold on 2 events (2*24=48 bytes).
  - 2 `double` or pointers or character strings plus 1 `int` or `float` can hold in 1 "parameter" event. So a log with two 64 bits and one 32 bits parameters also hold on 2 events (2*24=48 bytes).

On a CPU point of view, the runtime cost of a log is close to the event tracing one, especially with numeric parameters. As for tracing with standard events, dynamic strings add some cost due to the dynamic string hashing.

## Command Line Interface

CLIs are remotely executable functions which accept typed parameters. <br/>
Their typical usage, via Python scripts, is remote configuration, data injection or any stimulation of a program.

Specifying a CLI just requires the handler (=called function) and 3 strings:
  - the command name (no space allowed)
  - the parameter specification (see below)
  - a description, read by users

The following subsections describe the specification of the CLI parameters (used inside the instrumented program), and the CLI command itself (used inside a script).


### CLI parameter specification

The CLI parameter specification is a string which fully defines the input parameters of a CLI. <br/>
It contains the list of named parameters with their type and their optional default value.

This specification is a space separated concatenation of `&lt;parameter name&gt;=&lt;type&gt;`. <br/>
The type is among `integer`, `float` or `string`, optionally followed by a default parameter inside double brackets as `[[&lt;default value&gt;]]`.

Examples of parameter specification:
 * "`first=int second_param=float third=string`"
 * "`first=int second_param=float[[-3.14159265359]] third=string[[default string, and we can use space]]`"
 * ""    (empty)
 * "`msg=string`"

The syntax and content of the CLI parameter specification is verified when the CLI is registered. <br/>
Any misusage triggers a failed assertion with explanation.


### CLI command

The CLI command is a request string (in a script) which contains a CLI name followed by parameter values (if any) and corresponds to an intend of remote function execution.

The parameters values are a space separated concatenation of `&lt;parameter name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;`

  * the parameter order does not matter
  * the parameter name can be partial as long as it is not ambiguous
    * ex: `mi` is ok for the parameter spec "`min=int max=int`" but `m` is not
  * `value` shall be compatible with the declared type in the CLI parameter specification
  * parameters without a default value are mandatory, they must have a provided value in the CLI command
  * `string` values cannot contain a space (so are a "word") unless inside a double bracket just after the equal sign
    * ex: `param=apple` and `param=[[many fruits]]`

!!! note Rational of the string syntax
    The direct syntax is matching the enumeration case. Supporting a space-containing string introduces the question of the separator. <br/>
    One usage of such string is forwarding external CLI commands (not `Palanteer` one) to the program, and quotes signs (simple or double) may be used in that case. <br/>
    The double brackets were chosen as a trade-off, as they have a low occurrence probability in such context, and are human readable.

Valid examples of CLI commands, for the CLI:
  - named "`my::command`"
  - declared with the parameter spec "`first=int second_param=float[[-3.14159265359]] third=string[[default string, and we can use space]]`"

are:
  * "`my::command f=14`"
  * "`my::command second=5.3 f=14`"
  * "`my::command fi=1 third=cherry`"
  * "`my::command f=14 t=[[apple, banana and cherry]] s=5`"

These examples are invalid:
  * "`my::comm f=14`" because the CLI name must be complete (hashed...)
  * "`my::command sec=5.3`" because the mandatory parameter `first` has no value
  * "`my::command second_pa=5.3 f=banana`" because the parameter `first` has a value of the wrong type
  * "`my::command f=1 th=cherry and banana`" because the parameter `third` takes the value `cherry` and the `and banana` messes up the syntax. Double brackets should have been used.

!!!
    CLIs commands and more generally `Palanteer` Python scripts are agnostic to the language used by the instrumented program.

!!! warning
    When a CLI command is received by an instrumented program, the CLI handler is called only after checking the command syntax against the parameter specification. <br/>
    Any bad syntax in the request returns to the script a generic error status with an explanatory text message.
